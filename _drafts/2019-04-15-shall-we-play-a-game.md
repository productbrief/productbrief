*tl;dr*: Knowing the win-loss ratio can help you decide when to make a leap of faith in the absence of certainty.

## The Games We Play

Folks who know me know that I love board games. Increasingly, I've been learning more about game theory.

We all know about zero-sum games. A zero-sum game is a game, or more simply, a decision, in which the outcomes equal zero. If I win (+1 for me), then somebody else must lose (-1 for him). If take a step forward in lawn work (+1) but fall behind in laundry (-1).

Very commonly, we describe a situation as zero-sum and intend to imply that there must be winners and loses, and that such situations create competition.

Positive-sum and negative-sum games get much less attention than zero-sum games. In a positive sum game, outcomes total a value greater than zero. That means, in a game, we can both win to a degree. I might refer a client that I can't help very well to you (+1 for you), get a finder's fee for my pains (+1 for me), and still provide the best possible service to the client (+1 for her!). In a positive-sum "game" decision, that I can't go wrong, except maybe by going "less right". In a positive-sum game or decision, you win - at least statistically - as long as you play, as long as you decide _something_.

Conversely, a negative-sum decision is all about minimizing the badness of outcomes. Nuclear war, for instance, is decidedly a negative-sum game. But so is something like Russian Roulette because the outcomes are either 0 (you don't shoot yourself) or -1 (you do).

In a negative-sum game, as Matthew Broderick's character learns when playing nuclear war against the WOPR, the only way to win is not to play. Wargames, anyone?

Identifying the kind of game you are playing, the kind of decision you are making, helps you to understand the range of possible outcomes and that paths that lead to them.
