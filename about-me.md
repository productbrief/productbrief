I help companies document, support, market, sell, and improve their APIs and SDKs. I build docs and code samples for SDKs to help software developers quickly understand and make use of APIs. I work with marketing to promote our products. I work with sales to help close technical deals.

API documentation, product ownership, project management, code samples, quick start guides, training presentations, Spanish language, desktop publishing and layout.
