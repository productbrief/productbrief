tl;dr: Developer Hub ([www.developerhub.io](https://www.developerhub.io)) is a new product that makes it easy to create documentation in minutes. It is clean, has core features, and is headed in the right direction.

# the product:

Developer Hub is a new documentation product that clearly aims to get you writing and publishing quickly and easily. It succeeds. Within seconds of sitting down to the website, you'll be creating instantly available documentation. With no need to build, convert, or template your docs, this is SaaS publishing at its easiest.

Developer Hub has a simple and intuitive WYSIWYG editor, which means anybody can use it. Adding an image or a code block is as simple as a mouse click. The control panel is simple and reasonably intuitive. As a result, tasks like creating a new version from an existing version are also easy.

You get basic white-labeling options: you can customize the color scheme, logo, and favicon. Obviously this customization will not be enough for some enterprises. For most of us looking to just get up and running, it's plenty.

Google analytics: Increasingly, and especially for technical products, user documentation is a key part of strategy to market to the technical user that informs a purchasing decision. Docs writers also benefit by understanding the behavior of their users. For both of these requirements, easy Google Analytics integration is vital.
