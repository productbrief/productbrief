# tl;dr:

Developer Hub ([www.developerhub.io](https://www.developerhub.io)) is a new product that makes it easy to create documentation in minutes. It is clean, has core features, and is headed in the right direction.

# the product:

Developer Hub is a new documentation product that clearly aims to get you writing and publishing quickly and easily. It succeeds. Within minutes, no, seconds, really, of sitting down to the website, you'll be creating instantly available documentation. With no need to build, convert, or template your docs, this is SaaS publishing at its easiest.

You get basic white-labeling options: you can customize the color scheme, logo, and favicon. Obviously this customization will not be enough for some enterprises. For most of us looking to just get up and running, it's plenty.
